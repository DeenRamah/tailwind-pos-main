TAILWIND POS
============



Tailwind POS is a POS (Point of Sales) application built with [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/). I create this application in order to exercise myself to build web application in "traditional" way, without any module bundler/build tools such as webpack, rollup, postcss, etc. So yes, it load tailwind.css and alpine.js via CDN.
